# Reusable Intelligence Overview for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Introduction

This document outlines the reusable intelligence design implemented for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. It describes the *Agents* and *Skills* used to enable modular, scalable, and intelligent interaction within the AI-native book platform powered by Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## Architecture Overview

- *Master Agent:* Orchestrates multiple subagents and skills to provide seamless user experience.
- *Subagents:* Specialized AI modules handling specific tasks like Q&A, Translation, Personalization, Authentication, and Search.
- *Skills:* Reusable functional capabilities such as text summarization, keyword extraction, and context-aware answering.

## Agents

| Agent Name               | Responsibility                                                      | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content Parsing Agent    | Parses book content, extracts chapters, sections, and metadata      | Provides structured access to book content for other agents                                     |
| Q&A Agent               | Answers user questions based on book content                        | Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find and generate accurate answers                  |
| Translation Agent       | Translates book content into Urdu                                   | Provides on-demand translation to support multi-lingual users                                   |
| User Personalization Agent | Customizes content based on user background and preferences        | Adjusts explanations and complexity according to user’s hardware/software expertise              |
| Authentication Agent    | Manages user signup, signin, and profile data                       | Handles authentication flow and stores user preferences                                         |
| Search Agent            | Enables advanced semantic and keyword search inside the book       | Supports fast retrieval of relevant content based on user queries                               |

## Skills

| Skill Name                | Functionality                                                      | Use Cases                                                                                        |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Text Summarization Skill   | Summarizes long texts into concise overviews                     | Quick previews of chapters or sections                                                          |
| Keyword Extraction Skill   | Extracts important keywords and concepts                         | Enhances search relevance and content indexing                                                  |
| Context-Aware Answering Skill | Generates answers tailored to user’s query context              | Improves accuracy and relevance of Q&A responses                                                |
| Code Snippet Generation Skill | Generates code commands for Spec-Kit Plus based on user requests | Assists users in interacting with Spec-Kit Plus commands                                       |
| Multi-language Support Skill | Supports translation and localization of content                 | Enables multi-lingual learning environments                                                     |
| Voice-to-Text Skill        | Converts voice commands to text                                   | Enables voice interaction with the book (optional enhancement)                                  |

## How It Works

1. *User Interaction:*  
   User poses questions, requests translations, or searches content.

2. *Master Agent Delegation:*  
   Master agent routes requests to appropriate subagents (e.g., Q&A, Translation, Search).

3. *Skill Utilization:*  
   Subagents invoke relevant skills (e.g., summarization, keyword extraction) to process requests.

4. *Response Aggregation:*  
   Master agent collects outputs, applies personalization if user is logged in, and delivers final response.

## Example Use Cases

- *Q&A Interaction:*  
  User asks, "Explain ROS 2 architecture" → Routed to Q&A agent → Uses RAG + context-aware answering skill → Returns concise explanation.

- *Translation Request:*  
  User clicks "Translate to Urdu" on chapter → Translation agent invoked → Content translated and displayed inline.

- *Personalized Content:*  
  Logged-in user with beginner hardware background requests chapter → Personalization agent adjusts content complexity before display.

- *Search Query:*  
  User searches for "NVIDIA Isaac simulation" → Search agent retrieves relevant sections and summaries.

## Setup and Integration Notes

- Agents and skills are implemented as modular Claude Code subagents and callable functions.
- Spec-Kit Plus commands integrate with skill modules to automate tasks like code snippet generation.
- Authentication integrates with [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) to manage users and personalize experience.
- RAG chatbot embedded using FastAPI backend, Postgres Neon database, and Qdrant vector search.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add voice interface integration using Whisper for voice commands.
- Expand multi-language support beyond Urdu.
- Implement learning analytics for user progress tracking.
