# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Hackathon Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modular Docusaurus Textbook
Every chapter is a markdown file, integrating a modular book into a Docusaurus-based textbook platform.

### II. Secure User Authentication & Profiling
Implement secure user authentication and profiling via Better Auth to personalize content based on user's hardware/software background.

### III. Multilingual Support
Enable on-demand Urdu translation toggle for multilingual content delivery.

### IV. AI-Powered RAG Chatbot
Develop a RAG chatbot using OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, backed by FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant vector DB, capable of answering questions from full content and user-selected text.

### V. CI/CD & Embedding Updates
Establish full CI/CD pipeline with automated embedding updates, testing, and deployment processes.

### VI. Scalable & Reusable Architecture
Design a scalable architecture that supports future subagents and skills for enhanced reusability and extensibility.



## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Complexity must be justified.
